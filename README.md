# ![](docs/favicon.ico) NosTracker
A website dedicated to collecting information from the nostr network.

[website](https://marcodpt.github.io/nostracker/)

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Features
 - A website equivalent to caniuse for nostr NIPs.
 - Relevant information (stars, issues, license, last commit, etc.) and easy search.

## üì¢ Add my repository.
Go to the
[data.json](https://github.com/marcodpt/nostracker/blob/main/data.json)
file.

And add the following object to the end of the array.

```json
{
  "gh": "owner/repo",
  "nips": [],
  "category": "clients|relays|libraries|tools"
}
```

For example, for the damus application it is filled in as follows:

```json
{
  "gh": "damus-io/damus",
  "nips": [1, 4, 8, 10, 12, 19, 21, 25, 42, 56],
  "category": "clients"
}
```

See if your repository is already on the list before.

If applicable, edit instead of adding a new item.

Only open source repositories and pull requests from repository members will be
accepted.

In other cases, or if you need a new category, open an issue.
